                        <p>Amritsar district is one of the twenty three districts that make up the Indian state of Punjab. Located in the Majha region of Punjab, the city of Amritsar is the headquarters of this district. As of 2011, it is the second most
                            populous district of Punjab (out of 23), after Ludhiana.During British Rule Amritsar District was part of Lahore Division and was administratively subdivided into 3 tehsils namely - Amritsar, Ajnala and Tarn Taran.[3] However,
                            as part of the partition of India in 1947 Amritsar district was separated from the rest of the division and awarded to India. However, some parts like Patti & Khem Karan falls in the Lahore District but due to partition, these
                            towns became the part of Amritsar District. During the partition period, the Muslim population of the district, some 46%, left for Pakistan while Hindus and Sikhs from West Punjab in newly created Pakistan migrated in the opposite
                            direction. The Sikhs and Hindus (37% and 15.38%) were a majority in the Amritsar district constituting about 52% of the population together before the partition of 1947.

                                                    Jalandhar district is a district in Doaba region of the state of Punjab, India. The district headquarters is the city of Jalandhar. Before the Partition of India, Jalandhar was also the headquarters of the Jalandhar Division, with constituent districts
                                                    Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana, Ferozepur and Kangra. The entire Jalandhar Division was awarded to India when Punjab was partitioned.alandhar became part of the Persianate Ghaznavid Empire during the
                                                    reign of Ibrahim Shah sometime between 1058 and 1098, and by 1240, it was a fief of the Delhi Sultanate. In 1298, an army led by Ulugh Khan and Zafar Khan defeated in battle, and forced the retreat of
                                                    invading Mongols of the Chagatai Khanate.The sack and plunder of Delhi by Timur in 1398 gravely weakened the Delhi Sultanate and ushered in a period of lawlessness in the country. In 1416, the governor
                                                    of Jalandhar, Malik Tughan assassinated the governor of Sirhind, and later rebelled against Khizr Khan, before being defeated. In the following years Jasrath Khokhar led a series of raids across Jalandhar
                                                    as he challenged the authority of the Sultan. In 1441, Jalandhar came under the authority of Bahlol Lodi who was appointed governor of Lahore province. Lodi made peace with Jasrath, rebelled and in 1450
                                                    became sovereign of Delhi

                                                        and Kurukshetra districts of neighboring Haryana state to the east, and Kaithal district of Haryana to the southwest. Baba Ala Singh (1691â€“1765), a Sikh chieftain from the village Rampura Phul in

                                                        built a new city on the village, naming it as Patiala. He laid the foundations of a steady and stable state known as the Phulkian Dynasty south of Sirhind. In and around Patiala District he founded
