                                        150 CE through the geographical work of renowned geographer, Ptolemy. The city, consisting of several islands, was then ruled by native Agris and Kolis. These natives ruled the islands up to 1345. Thereafter, Mumbai's
                                        rulers changed through history until Islamic rulers conquered what is now Maharashtra and conquered some of the islands in 1534. Subsequently, sultan of Gujarat took over all the islands, which were then conquered
                                        by the Portuguese. Following the continued support of England in the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, stemming from the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 and on the accession of a Catholic monarch in 1660, in 1661 the island

                                            <p>Pune district (Marathi pronunciation) is a district in Western Maharashtra with Administrative Headquarter in Pune city. Pune district is the most populous district in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is
                                                one of the most industrialised districts in India.The first reference to the Pune region is found on two copper plates, dated to 758 and 768 CE and issued by the Rashtrakuta ruler Krishna I. The plates call
                                                the region "Puny Vishaya" and "Punaka Vishaya", respectively. The Pataleshwar rock-cut temple complex was built during this time, and the area included Theur, Uruli, Chorachi Alandi, and Bhosari.[13] The
                                                region became part of the Yadava Empire of Deogiri from the ninth to the 13th centuries. The Muslim Khalji rulers of the Delhi Sultanate overthrew the Yadavas in 1317, beginning three hundred years of Islamic
                                                control. The Khalji were followed by another sultanate dynasty, the Tughlaqs. A Tughlaq governor on the Deccan Plateau rebelled and created the Bahamani Sultanate, which later dissolved into the Deccan sultanates.
                                                During the 1400s, Russian traveler Afanasy Nikitin spent many months in Junnar during the monsoon season and vividly describes life in the region under Bahamani rule.[14] The fort at Chakan played an important
                                                role in the history of the Deccan sultanates

                                                    Sindhudurg district (Marathi pronunciation) is an administrative district of the Konkan division in India, which was carved out of the erstwhile Ratnagiri district. The district headquarters are located at Oros and the district occupies an area of approximately
                                                    5,207 km2 and has a population of 849,651, of which 12.59% were urban (as of 2011).[1] As of 2011, it's the least populous district of Maharashtra.The word 'Konkan' is of Indian origin and considerable
                                                    antiquity, though the origin of the name has never been definitively explained. The seven kingdoms of the Konkan of mythology are mentioned in the History of Kashmir and are said to have included nearly
                                                    the whole west coast of India. The Pandavas are said to have passed through this region in the 13th year of their exile and to have settled in this area for some time. The Raja of this region, Veerat
                                                    Ray, accompanied them in the war at Kurukshetra with the Kauravas.[3] In the second century A.D., the Maurya Empire annexed the Konkan coast. In the middle of the sixth century, kings of the Maurya and
                                                    Nala dynasties appear to have ruled in the Konkan.
