                            Bhopal district was carved out of the erstwhile Sehore District of Bhopal division vide M.P.Govt. Notification No.2477/1977/Sa/One/ dated 13 September 1972.The district derives its name from the district head-quarters town Bhopal which is also the capital
                            of Madhya Pradesh. According to the Imperial Gazeteer of India, Bhopal derives from "Bhoj Pal" named after the legendary founder of the city.[3] The early history of the present-day district area is obscure. According to a
                            legend, the area was part of Mahakautar, a barrier of dense forests and hills separating North India from South India. 10th century CE onwards, names of Rajput rulers (including Bhoja) Malwa appear in the historical records.
                            The number of Muslims rose after invasions by the Delhi Sultanate under Iltutmish.
