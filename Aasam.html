                            Cachar district is an administrative district in the state of Assam in India. After independence, the undivided Cachar district was split into four districts in Assam: Dima Hasao district (formerly North Cachar Hills), and Cachar district alongside Hailakandi
                            and Karimganj.The Kacharis (Kachari kingdom) have given their name to the modern district of Cachar. The Kacharis call themselves Barman in Barak valley and Dimasa in the Dima Hasao district. They were known to the Ahoms as
                            Timisa, a corruption of the word "Dimasa". The Kacharis are allied to the Boro, Koches, Chutias, Lalungs (aka Tiwa), and Morans of the Brahmaputra valley and to the Garos and Tripuras of the southern hills.Cachar district occupies
                            an area of 3,786 square kilometres (1,462 sq mi),[4] comparatively equivalent to South Georgia.[5] The Barak is the main river of the district, and apart from numerous small rivers that flow through the Dima Hasao district,

                                Darrang is an administrative district in the state of Assam in India. The district headquarters are located at Mangaldoi. The district occupies an area of 1585 km2.No definitive records about Darrang are available for the pre-medieval period. According
                                to Maheswar Neog, the Darrang became mentioned only after the uprising of the king Nara Narayan. Darrang at different times might have been under the rule of the Chutia Kingdom, Bodo people and Baro-Bhuyans.[2] During the
                                reign of Dharmanarayan 3000 Chutia families were established in Darrang.According to Scholar Late Dineswar Sarma, the word Darrang came from Dawrang which means Gateway.In the 16th century, Darrang was subject to the Kamata
                                king Nara Narayan, and on the division of his dominion among his heirs, Darrang became a part of Koch Hajo. Early in the 17th century the raja Bali Narayan invoked the aid of the Ahoms of Upper Assam against the Mughal
                                invaders; after his defeat and death in 1637 the Ahoms dominated the whole district.

                                    Dibrugarh is an industrial city in Upper Assam with sprawling tea gardens. It is located 435 kms East from the state capital of Dispur. It serves as the headquarters of Dibrugarh district in the state of Assam in India. Dibrugarh serves as the headquarters
                                    of the Sonowal Kachari Autonomous Council, which is the governing council of the Sonowal Kachari tribe (found predominantly in the Dibrugarh district).Dibrugarh derived its name from Dibarumukh (as a renowned encampment
                                    of Ahoms during the Ahom-Chutia conflict). Either the name “Dibru” evolved from Dibaru river or from the Bodo-Kachari word “Dibru” which means a “blister” and “Garh” meaning "fort".Dibrugarh hosts several tea gardens
                                    dating back to the British era. The first garden was at Chabua, a place 20 miles (32 km) away from Dibrugarh, owned by Maniram Devaan.[20] Today, the headquarters of the Directorate of Development of Small Tea Growers
                                    in India is functioning from Dibrugarh.
